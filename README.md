# What is it?
This is my personal implementation of standard library for c, that I grew up to up.
It's bad, but it's also mine and makes my life much easier

# Structure
structure is very weird, there is a lot of unused and unfinished parts.

# Versioning
There is no (stable?) version, and never will be. It will be changed every time I feel like pushing local changes or will need to sync it between machines
